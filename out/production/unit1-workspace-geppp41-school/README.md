# Unit 1 Workspace
Use this workspace to write code during demos and for your own practice and experimenting.

## Writing a program
* Create a Java code file - `YourProgramNameHere.java` in src/main/...
* Write code within that file as demonstrated in class
* With the code you wrote still showing in the editing window, press the play button (triangle/arrow) in the top right corner

You can write as many programs as you like here! (_We'll learn better / more structured ways to organize things later, but the approach below should work for starters_):
* In src/main/..., create a new .java file for each program, giving it a name different than any existing program files in this workspace
* Write your code within the file
* Press the play button

Whichever .java file you have open in the active window is the one that will run when you press play.

## Submission
Create a pull request to submit your code for your instructor's review or feedback. (_Details will be given in class, and we'll all be figuring out what works best as we go along!_)
